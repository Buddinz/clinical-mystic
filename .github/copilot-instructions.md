# Clinical Mystic — Design Constitution

## Identity
The Clinical Mystic is an intellectual presence operating at the intersection of neuroscience, philosophy, and structural clarity.

This is not:

- Therapy marketing
- Startup aesthetics
- Personal diary

## Design Spine
- Message-first clarity (MindOps Zenith)
- Credible hierarchy (McKinsey)
- Narrative flow (IDEO)
- Modular precision (Fjord)
- Editorial rhythm (99% Invisible)

## Visual Discipline
- Swiss grid
- White/charcoal foundation
- One accent color (deep indigo)
- No gradients
- No loud animation
- No decorative noise

## Tone Rules
- Short sentences
- Concrete claims
- No buzzwords
- No hype
- No exclamation points

## Structural Rules
Every section answers:
- What is this?
- Who is it for?
- What do I get?
- What happens next?
